### Phantomjs with node 

This is a simple ubuntu build with npm, node (iojs) and phantomjs installed. 

It's bloated as hell, but its intention is as a build-tool and consequently has most of those extra tools added in. 
It is not intended for production deployments.

### Phantomjs
installed globally at `/usr/local/bin/phantomjs`
